Custom languages on GitHub
I've found that it is possible to enable (some) syntax highlighting on GitHub for custom languages by putting this:

    *.ext linguist-language=SupportedLanguage linguist-vendored

to the .gitattributes file.
Just change the ext to the file extension your language is using and use the most similar supported language.

The linguist-vendored is to make sure it's not counted as the similar language.
More info in the docs.

Additionally it is needed to put this:

    root = true

    [*.ext]
    indent_style = tab
    indent_size = 4

to the .editorconfig file to set the tab size. More info in the docs.
