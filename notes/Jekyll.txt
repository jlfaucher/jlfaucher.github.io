To use the Cayman Jekyll theme on your GitHub Pages site:

    1. In your repository, open the publishing source branch and edit _config.yml.

    2. Add this line (or update the existing theme line): theme: jekyll-theme-cayman

    3. Commit the change (create a branch + PR if you're on the default branch).

    4. (Optional) Customize CSS:
       create assets/css/style.scss and add at top: @import "{{ site.theme }}";
       then add your custom CSS/Sass below that line and commit.

    5. (Optional) Customize HTML layout:
       copy _layouts/_default.html from the theme repo
       (https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman)
       into your site as _layouts/default.html and edit.

    6. Preview locally: install Jekyll and Bundler, run bundle install, then bundle exec jekyll serve and visit http://localhost:4000.

Notes:

    . Cayman is one of the supported GitHub Pages themes, so using
      theme: jekyll-theme-cayman will let Pages build your site automatically.

    . If you need unsupported plugins or other custom build steps, build locally
      or via Actions and push the generated static files.


cd /local/github
mkdir cayman
cd cayman

What's the difference between SCSS and Sass?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Convert .scss to .css

There are several methods to convert SCSS files to CSS, ranging from command-line tools to online converters.

Using the command-line tool sass, which is part of the Sass ecosystem, is a common approach.
First, install Sass using one of the following methods:
   via Ruby's gem system with gem install sass
 , using Homebrew on macOS with brew install sass/sass/sass
 , or via Node.js with npm install -g sass.

 Once installed, navigate to the directory containing your SCSS file using the terminal.

 To compile a single SCSS file to CSS, run the command sass input.scss output.css.

 To automatically recompile the CSS whenever changes are saved in the SCSS file, use the --watch flag:
    sass --watch input.scss output.css.
 This command can also be used with directories, such as
     sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets
 to watch a folder and output compiled CSS to another folder.


Alternatively, online tools provide a quick and easy way to convert SCSS to CSS without installing any software. Websites such as
   CodeShack        https://codeshack.io/scss-to-css-converter/
 , GeeksforGeeks    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/utilities/scss-to-css-converter/
 , Json2CSharp      https://json2csharp.com/css-tools/scss-to-css
 , olacss.com       https://olacss.com/scss-to-css-converter
 , LambdaTest       https://www.lambdatest.com/free-online-tools/scss-to-css
 , bfotool          https://bfotool.com/scss-to-css
 , CodeBeautify     https://codebeautify.org/scss-to-css-converter
 , and others allow you to paste your SCSS code directly into a web form or upload an SCSS file.
 After clicking a "Convert" button, the tool instantly generates the corresponding CSS, which can be copied or downloaded.
 These tools support common SCSS features like variables, nesting, mixins, and functions.


I install with Homebrew:
brew install node-sass

cd /local/github/cayman/git/_sass
sass jekyll-theme-cayman.scss

Breaking Change: @import and global built-in functions

    Originally, Sass used @import rules to load other files with a single global namespace,
    with all built-in functions also available globally. We’re deprecating both Sass @import
    rules and global built-in functions now that the module system (@use and @forward rules)
    has been available for several years.


Automatic MigrationAutomatic Migration permalink
    You can use the Sass migrator to automatically update your stylesheets to use the module system.

    $ npm install -g sass-migrator
    $ sass-migrator module --migrate-deps your-entrypoint.scss
    If you want to migrate away from global built-in functions, but aren’t yet ready to fully migrate your @import rules,
    you can pass the --built-in-only flag to migrate the functions while leaving @import rules as-is.
